# The Ultimate Hardware Hacking Gear Guide


### Thank you for downloading the e-zine. I am actively collecting feedback, fixing the links, improving the translations, and giving proper credit to the original creators of the projects (I apologize for any oversights). Gradually, I am enhancing the magazine, and your feedback is greatly appreciated! Releasing content in English is a bit challenging since I live in Brazil and it is not my primary language, but with the help of researchers and the community, I am dedicated to improving the magazine!
